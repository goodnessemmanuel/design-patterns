# Structural design pattern using Java
Presenting the design pattern described in the GOF(Gang of four) in an example driven way.
### Definition
A pattern is a reusable and a named solution to a recurring problem in a context.
Why design patterns are important:
- Communication
    - It actually serves as a means of communicating a problem to other developers. You may very well already know how to solve a particular problem
- Common vocabulary
    - It is better to have a common vocabulary what a problem really is.
- Abstract topic
- Revisit
    - it is pretty common to revisit pattern materials to understand the approach used to solve recurring problem.

The structural design include:
- Adapter pattern
- Bridge pattern
- Composite pattern
- Decorator pattern
- Facade pattern
