# Behavioural design pattern using Java
Presenting the design pattern described in the GOF(Gang of four) in an example driven way.
### Definition
A pattern is a reusable and a named solution to a recurring problem in a context.
Why design patterns are important:
- Communication
  - It actually serves as a means of communicating a problem to other developers. You may very well already know how to solve a particular problem
- Common vocabulary
  - It is better to have a common vocabulary what a problem really is.
- Abstract topic
- Revisit
  - it is pretty common to revisit pattern materials to understand the approach used to solve recurring problem.

The behavioral pattern contains the most number of patterns in the GOF. Some of which include:
- Chain of responsibility
- Command
- Interpreter
- Iterator
- Mediator
- Momento
- Observer
- State
- Strategy
- Template Method
